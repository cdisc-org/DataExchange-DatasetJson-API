# DataExchange-DatasetJson-API

This repo will be used to collaboratively author a Dataset-JSON API specification as part of a 6-week hackathon that 
will subsequently be fed to the standards team.

To review the Dataset-JSON API specification use the HTML version named dataset-json-api.html.

Note: The openapi/dataset-json-api.yaml has been deprecated and replaced by openapi/dataset-json-api.json.

## Description

The main purpose of *DataExchange-DatasetJson-API* is to create a draft API specification for Dataset-JSON and 
proof-of-concept implementations to demonstrate and test the API specification.
