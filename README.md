# DataExchange-DatasetJson-API
This repository contains the Dataset-JSON API Specification v1.0 and associated User Guide. This API standard complements
the [Dataset-JSON CDISC Data Exchange standard](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson).

To review the Dataset-JSON API Specification, use the HTML version [dataset-json-api-1-0.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API/blob/main/doc/dataset-json-api-1-0.html). 

To review the Dataset-JSON API User Guide, see the Markdown version [dataset-json-api-1-0-ug](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API/blob/main/doc/dataset-json-api-1-0-ug.md).

To review the Dataset-JSON API Specification as OAS, see the JSON version [dataset-json-api-1-0.json](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API/blob/main/openapi/dataset-json-api-1-0.json). 

## Description
The main purpose of *DataExchange-DatasetJson-API* is to create a standard API specification for exchanging 
Dataset-JSON datasets.

The API endpoints, payloads, and other details are available in the JSON and HTML versions of the specification. 
The User Guide provides additional information useful to client and server API implementers.

Please add any comments or issues into the GitHub repository under Discussions or Issues, respectively.

The API specification has been developed using the machine-readable
[Open API Specification (OAS) 3.1 standard](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). API specifications in OAS format can be used to generate 
documentation as well as to generate code for API clients. Check out this [list of OAS tools](https://openapi.tools/). 

For those interested in generating content using the API specification, see the JSON version in the 
openapi folder. The [dataset-json-api-1-0.json](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API/blob/main/openapi/dataset-json-api-1-0.json) 
file contains the machine-readable specification used to generate the HTML documentation file 
[dataset-json-api-1-0.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API/blob/main/doc/dataset-json-api-1-0.html).
