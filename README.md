# DataExchange-DatasetJson-API

This repo will was originally used to collaboratively author a Dataset-JSON API specification as part of a 6-week COSA hackathon 
that will subsequently be fed to the Dataset-JSON standards team. As an outcome of the COSA hackathon, we now have a draft API specification
available for review.

To review the Dataset-JSON API specification use the HTML version named dataset-json-api.html.

## Description

The main purpose of *DataExchange-DatasetJson-API* is to create an API specification for Dataset-JSON.

To review the HTML specification document, clone this repository so that the swagger-ui folder is available as this
content is needed to properly render the HTML document. The API endpoints, payloads, and other details are available
in the HTML specification. Please add any comments or issues into the GitHub repository under Discussions or Issues.

The API specification has been developed using the machine-readable 
[Open API Specification (OAS) 3.1 standard](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). API specifications in OAS 
format can be used to generate documentation as well as to generate code for API clients. 
Check out this [list of OAS tools](https://openapi.tools/). 

For those that might be interested in generating content using the API specification, see the JSON version in the 
openapi folder. The dataset-json-api.json file contains the machine-readable specification used to generate the 
HTML documentation file (dataset-json-api.html).
